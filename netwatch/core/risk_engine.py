"""
NetWatch - Risk Scoring Engine
Calculates a 0-100% risk score from scan and firewall results.

Scoring weights:
  - Critical port open (21, 22, 23, 445, 3389): +20 each
  - Risky port open (HTTP, DB, VNC, etc.):       +15 each
  - Firewall High severity issue:                +15 each
  - Firewall Medium severity issue:              +10 each
  - Firewall Low severity issue:                 + 2 each
  - Score is capped at 100.
